      Sri Lanka is currently in the midst of an economic crisis where the Sri Lankan government is running low on foreign currency and as a result has been unable to pay for essential imports such as fuel, food items and other essential goods. Sri Lankans have had to contend with debilitating power cuts lasting 13 hours, inflation rates crossing 17% and a steeply devalued currency.
      The island nation faces fuel shortages because of its escalating debt and foreign currency crisis. Several power generating plants have ground to a halt or are running at under capacity. The country’s hydro power stations have also been adversely impacted by low dam levels caused by dry weather conditions.
      While electricity cuts and shortage of petroleum products have been frequent in recent months, the crisis has taken a more drastic turn, with the day-to-day activities of millions of people and their livelihoods disrupted.
      Sri Lanka’s fuel shortage, diesel in particular, is impacting on transport with long queues outside fuel distribution stations. National Water Supply and Drainage Board sources told the media that water supplies will be affected because of power disruptions at purifying plants and the lack of alternative electricity supplies.
      Desperate to drive up foreign exchange earnings, the government has exempted export-processing free trade zones from the cuts. Big business fears have been reflected in sharp falls on the Sri Lankan stock market. On February, the stock market suffered its steepest fall with 700 billion rupees wiped off share values.

    Sri Lanka is struggling to secure fresh fuel supplies, a top government minister said on Sunday, as the crisis-hit country of 22 million people is down to just 15,000 tons of petrol and diesel to keep essential services running in the coming days.The island is wilting under its worst financial crisis in seven decades with foreign exchange reserves at record lows leaving it scrambling to pay for essential imports including fuel, food and medicine.
    In the past two months Sri Lanka largely recieved fuel via a $500 million Indian credit line, which ran out in mid-June. A petrol shipment due last Thursday failed to arrive and no fresh shipments are yet scheduled, Wijesekera said. Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said new fuel shipments were being lined up but the country is struggling to raise enough funds to pay as the central bank can supply only about $125 million.Sri Lanka only has 12,774 tons of diesel and 4,061 tons of petrol left in its government reserves, he told reporters in Colombo , the commercial centre of the island nation.
    Anyway, the situation seems to have improved a little and we are always working to provide our best for our valued customers. Here are some of the new laws, bills and new regulations introduced by the government to obtain oil.
